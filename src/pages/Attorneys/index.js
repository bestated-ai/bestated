                    By having employers add this to their benefits packages, we aim to make estate planning an easy and accessible process for the 67% of US adults who don’t currently have a will or estate plan.

                    While the use of genAI can shorten the traditional process of drafting these legal documents, we still need our attorney partners to review and notarize them.
